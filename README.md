# Introduction

These is my repo for learning GO language

# Structure

* `go_by_example` contains resources from https://gobyexample.com/
* vim-go contains files from the vim-go-tutorial available in github.
* cgo contains projects that combine C compiled shared libraries and GO. This is
    a first step towards kodo-go bindings.
